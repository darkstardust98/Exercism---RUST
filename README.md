README.md file use: DOCUMENTING MY EXERCISM REFLECTIONS

I will be updating this README.md file with various reflections on the exercisms I have completed during the learning process.
Complete track viewable at: https://exercism.org/tracks/rust

1-hello_world
Extremely basic task, println! for the win.

2-gigasecond
Immediately humbling after exercise 1. 
The module structure of the exercises is still not completely clear to me, but the same is true for project structure in general in rust for me.
Have to keep grinding.
After banging my head for one evening, the solution was way easier than I initially thought.
Simplicity > Complexity;

3-clock
I was not able to resolve the numerous comand line errors I was getting, so I decided to move on to the next exercise for now.
I will come back to this one later.

4-anagram
I think I am starting to get the hang of the module structure of the exercises. Still a lot of errors are popping up and I am not sure how to resolve them.
I will keep grinding.
